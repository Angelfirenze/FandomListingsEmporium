When I get a passion for a new fandom, pairing, band, television show, movie, character, etc., I usually make an addition about it here in what was originally a Livejournal entry about such that became of rather extraordinary length and needed rather some organization after a time.

I decided to make it as well-done-so as possible, by including the paragraph align JS commands, as well as subsecting it into various fandoms and alphabetically, after that.  All told, it rather took a long time, but was - like when I wrote the <a href="" target="_blank">fanfiction collection</a> entry - manhours well spent, in my view, and continue to be whenever I update it.
